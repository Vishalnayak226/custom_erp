Every error dialog in the app shows a code like `GLOBAL-0001`. Look it up here.

There are **510** codes. Each row says what the user is shown, what to do about
it, and how serious it is.

**How to read an error dialog** - it has up to three lines: the *headline* (the
catalog's User Message, below), the *detail* (the specific field or value that
failed, written by the engine that rejected it), and the *action* (the User
Action column, below). The detail line is usually the one that tells you what to
fix. See [USER_GUIDE](USER_GUIDE.md) §12.
